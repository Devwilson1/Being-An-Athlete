      <h4><b>Devin Wilson</b></h4> 
      <p>CEO & Athlete</p> 
      <p>My Name is Devin Wilson and I am a 15 year black 
  male entrepenuear who is an Athlete. I play football 
  and baseball at the highschool level and while 
  participating in these spots I have learned that the
  recruitment process is hard. That is what sparked my 
  Idea for my buissness and I want to make it well 
  known and used all over the country. Some more
  about me is that I am from Oakland, CA and I have 2 
  brothers. I am apart of the Hidden Genius project and 
  I am in cohort Oak Black 9.  With my buissness I 
  want to bring awareness to the technicalities and
  struggles of being recruited as a high school athlete
  and that is what I intend to do for Athletes all around 
  the world.</p>
